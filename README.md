## üìã Requirements

- Python with Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Flask-Login
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

2. Run the application:
```bash
python run.py
```

3. Access the application:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## üìä Architecture

The app follows an elegant, maintainable architecture:

1. `run.py` - Main entry point that creates the Flask instance
2. `app/config.py` - Configuration settings (debug/production mode, secret, DB settings)
3. `app/__init__.py` - App initialization including database setup
4. `app/authentication/` - Handles login/signup and user management
5. `app/home/` - Contains main application functionality
6. `app/home/twofa.py` - Core OTP generation logic with `otp_gen` class

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. User logs in through the landing page (`/login`)
2. After authentication, user is redirected to the main page (`otp.html`)
3. User can paste new secrets in the input area
4. The app processes and normalizes different secret formats
5. OTPs are generated and displayed with countdown timers
6. Users can save secrets for future sessions or delete them as needed
7. OTPs can be copied to clipboard with a single click
